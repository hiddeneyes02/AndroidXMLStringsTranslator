# Android XML Translator Helper

This is a quick tool to help translate your Android xml strings into different languages, using Google translate or 
any other translation tool.

No version has been released yet. So you need to import the project into IntelliJ to work with it.

Check below video for instruction on how to use.

## Steps

1- Run the project

2- Copy xml strings you want to translate

3- Click top **Paste** button on the application

4- Click **Prepare**

5- Paste prepared content into your translation tool

6- Copy translated text

7- Click on the second **Paste** button in the application

8- Check **Include root** if you are translating the whole xml file

8- Click **Convert**

9- Translated xml strings will be copied to your clipboard

### Disclaimer
This is not an accurate app to translate strings. This app depends on other tools to actually translate the text. So 
don't rely on it to do a perfect translation.
